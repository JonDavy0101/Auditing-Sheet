# Auditing-Sheet
> The Auditing Sheet was made to help me and other fellow coworkers to quickly and efficiently enter our auditing data. I started out by making a simple Excel workbook to record daily data, but this quickly turned into a very detailed and extensive project allowing the auditor to not only enter data but also to obtain automated detailed reports of that data and more. Throughout the months, I have continually added new macros to make the Auditing Sheet more automated and user-friendly. It is important to note that this project will very likely not work with yours. The purpose of this project is to show you what I have done, and hopefully it will inspire you to create your own that works the way you want it.
