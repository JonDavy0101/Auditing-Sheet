# Auditing-Sheet
The Auditing Sheet was made to help me and other fellow coworkers to quickly and efficiently enter our auditing data. I started out by making a simple Excel workbook to record daily data, but this quickly turned into a very detailed and extensive project allowing the auditor to not only enter data but also to obtain automated detailed reports of that data and more. Throughout the months, I have continually added new macros to make the Auditing Sheet more automated and user-friendly.

In this project, I have included a sample of my Auditing Sheet. I am constantly adding to this sheet. Keep checking back for further updated materials.
